# Ronan's Optimized Cursor AI Collaboration Rules

## 🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Advanced AI collaboration system optimized for token efficiency while preserving sophisticated functionality. Cost reduction target: $85/day → $8-15/day through surgical optimization.

## 📋 SESSION LENS PROTOCOL
**CRITICAL**: Focus on 4-6 items max per session (67% efficiency gain validated)
- Identify session priorities early
- Compress context to essential elements only
- Use session-continuity templates for context preservation
- Maintain working relationship DNA across sessions

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### Code Quality & Safety
- Always preserve existing functionality during modifications
- Use relative paths for all file references
- Maintain YAML frontmatter integrity in Obsidian files
- Validate date formats: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format only
- Test changes incrementally, not comprehensively

### File Handling Protocols
- Never modify files without explicit user confirmation
- Create backups for critical configuration changes
- Use session-continuity templates for consistent structure
- Use active session context (13-ACTIVE-SESSION-CONTEXT-OPTIMIZED.md) for real-time tracking
- Compress frequent-load documents to <5KB when possible (active context <2KB)

### AI Collaboration Patterns
- Leverage user's 25 years web experience - assume sophisticated understanding
- Challenge assumptions and ask "could we do this faster?"
- Reference user's proven methodologies and 24-page research
- Apply implementation gap detection: "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?"
- Focus on reusable, portable solutions across projects

## 🎪 COMMUNICATION STYLE
- Direct, honest feedback over diplomatic language
- Systems thinking and enterprise-grade reliability
- Rapid iteration with real-world validation
- Meta-conversation about improving collaboration itself
- Quality obsession with user-driven refinement

## 🛠️ TOOL INTEGRATION
- Metadata management for workflow optimization
- AI interview triggers (HTML comment blocks) for template customization
- Session entrance prompts for context preservation
- Active session context tracking for real-time micro-context preservation
- Deviation tracking for learning from system changes

## 📊 TOKEN OPTIMIZATION
- Vault indexing protection via .cursorindexingignore
- Session-scoped context loading only
- Compressed document templates while preserving functionality
- Strategic file boundaries (active work only, not entire vault)
- Mathematical efficiency validation (session lens approach)
