# Session Continuity AI Collaboration System

A sophisticated AI collaboration framework designed to transform expensive Cursor AI costs while preserving 100% of advanced functionality through surgical token optimization.

## üß© System Metadata

> This project uses the **Ronan Session Continuity System** to maintain structured context across AI-assisted writing and documentation workflows.

‚úÖ Strategic files include:
- `session-id`, `linked-notes`, `summary`, and `context-priority` metadata
- Modular sections marked with `^block-id` for reuse
- Model routing rules that elevate context depth automatically
- An active `prompt-library/` with operational prompt files
- A `00-CONTINUITY-INDEX.md` listing session-aware files

üìò For full usage: see [`README.md`](./README.md), [`00-CONTINUITY-INDEX.md`](./session-continuity/00-CONTINUITY-INDEX.md), or browse [`prompt-library/`](./prompt-library)

## üß† Purpose of the Session Continuity System for Cursor

This system is designed to create **persistent, structured memory inside Cursor**, enabling you to build and reuse deep context across editing sessions, projects, and strategic documents.

At its core, the system transforms your Obsidian-style vault into a **memory-aware workspace** by:

### üéØ Key Goals

- **Simulating memory**: Using `session-id`, `linked-notes`, and summaries in frontmatter, Cursor can recognize anchor files and recall them intelligently.
- **Enabling reuse**: With block IDs and Obsidian-style embeds, you build modular, live-referenced notes that can be updated once and echoed everywhere.
- **Controlling model behavior**: Smart rules interpret metadata (like `context-priority`) to automatically route complex tasks to higher-capacity models.
- **Navigating with intent**: A centralized session index helps both you and Cursor understand which documents are active, strategic, or linked.
- **Scaling understanding**: A README file serves as a protocol layer, training Cursor (and future collaborators) on how to think with your system.

### ‚öôÔ∏è What It Changes About Working in Cursor

- Files become **semantic memory nodes**, not just static documents.
- Model selection becomes **context-sensitive**, not manual guesswork.
- Editing becomes **intentional and layered**, not reactive or fragmented.
- Your vault becomes **an intelligent system**, not just a collection of files.

## Ronan Session Continuity System

This project uses a structured memory approach to enable reasoning continuity across strategic notes. Key components include:

- `session-id`: declares that a file is part of a persistent context thread
- `linked-notes`: references related files to build semantic graph context
- `summary`: describes the note's role in supporting AI or human continuity
- `context-priority`: flags files that require deeper model awareness
- `^block-id`: marks reusable logic blocks for modular reference
- `00-CONTINUITY-INDEX.md`: indexes active session-aware notes

This README may be pinned in Cursor or Windsurf to help initialize context in memory-aware sessions.

## üéØ **Mission**

## üß† Session Continuity System Reference

This project uses a structured memory system to help both AI and human collaborators preserve context over time. Key practices include:

- Metadata fields like `session-id`, `linked-notes`, and `context-priority`
- Block IDs (`^block-id`) for modular reuse across notes
- A `00-CONTINUITY-INDEX.md` that lists active session-aware notes
- Cursor rules that elevate model depth based on strategic context

This README should be pinned in Cursor during editing to help orient the agent to this logic layer.
