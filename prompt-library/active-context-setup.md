# âš¡ Prompt: Active Session Context Setup

## âœ¨ Purpose
This prompt guides the setup and configuration of the Active Session Context system for real-time micro-context preservation and seamless interruption recovery.

## ðŸ§  Prompt

I want to set up active session context tracking for this project to improve interruption recovery and preserve micro-decisions during work.

Please help me by:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Initial Setup Protocol**

**1. Template Activation**
* Confirm `13-ACTIVE-SESSION-CONTEXT-OPTIMIZED.md` exists in session-continuity/
* Trigger the HTML customization guide if present
* Walk through the template configuration interview

**2. Session Integration**
* Link active context to current session plan (`02-SESSION-PLAN-OPTIMIZED.md`)
* Ensure session lens methodology integration (4-6 items max)
* Connect to session entrance prompts for context restoration

**3. Tool State Configuration**
* Identify primary tools for this project/session
* Set up tool effectiveness tracking patterns
* Configure real-time tool state monitoring

**4. Focus Item Setup**
* Transfer current focus items from session plan to active context
* Establish micro-decision documentation patterns
* Set up interruption recovery checkpoints

### ðŸ”§ **Configuration Questions**

Walk me through:
* What are the 4-6 primary focus items for this session?
* Which tools will be actively used and need state tracking?
* What types of micro-decisions should be captured?
* How frequently should context be updated?
* What interruption patterns are most common for this work?

### ðŸ“Š **Validation Setup**

After configuration:
* Test token efficiency (<2KB target)
* Verify session lens compliance
* Confirm integration with existing session continuity system
* Validate HTML triggers work for guided updates

### ðŸš€ **Best Practices**

Establish patterns for:
* **Real-time updates**: Update context during natural work breaks
* **Tool tracking**: Document tool effectiveness as you work
* **Micro-decisions**: Capture implementation choices that affect flow
* **Interruption preparation**: Record critical state before breaks
* **Recovery optimization**: Structure context for quick resumption
