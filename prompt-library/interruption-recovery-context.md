# ðŸ”„ Prompt: Interruption Recovery Context Restoration

## âœ¨ Purpose
This prompt helps restore complete work context after interruptions (meetings, breaks, context switches) using the Active Session Context system for immediate productivity resumption.

## ðŸ§  Prompt

I've just returned from [break/meeting/interruption] and need to restore my work context seamlessly.

Please help me by:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Context Restoration Protocol**

**1. Active Context Review**
* Open `13-ACTIVE-SESSION-CONTEXT-OPTIMIZED.md`
* Read the last known state and context snapshot
* Identify where I was in the implementation flow

**2. Tool State Assessment**
* Check tool status and effectiveness from active context
* Verify if any tools need reactivation or state refresh
* Review recent tool results and discoveries

**3. Focus Item Progression**
* Review current focus items (session lens: 4-6 max)
* Identify which item was actively being worked on
* Determine immediate next action for resumption

**4. Decision Context Restoration**
* Review last decision made and reasoning
* Check current working hypothesis or approach
* Restore variables, settings, or critical state information

**5. Implementation Flow Resumption**
* Identify current code location or work area
* Review pending validations or tests needed
* Restore micro-context about what was being discovered

### ðŸ”§ **Validation Checklist**
- [ ] Active session context provides clear resumption point
- [ ] Tool states are understood and ready
- [ ] Next action is immediately actionable
- [ ] No critical context has been lost
- [ ] Can resume productive work within 2 minutes

### ðŸ“Š **Update Active Context**
After restoration, update the active session context with:
* Current resumption timestamp
* Any new context from the interruption
* Adjusted focus items or priorities
* Tool state confirmations
