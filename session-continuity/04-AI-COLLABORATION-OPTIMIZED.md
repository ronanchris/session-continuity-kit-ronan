# AI Collaboration Intelligence - {{project_name}}

<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Establish sophisticated AI partnership parameters based on user's 25 years web experience and advanced systematic approach. Configure meta-collaboration patterns for enterprise-grade collaboration. -->

## üß† Working Relationship DNA
**User Profile**: Advanced practitioner (25 years web, 5 months intensive Cursor)
**Communication Preference**: Direct, honest feedback; challenge assumptions
**Innovation Mindset**: "Could we do this faster?" + systematic reusability
**Quality Standards**: Enterprise-grade reliability, safety-first approach

## üéØ Collaboration Sophistication Level
**Systematic Approach**: ‚úÖ User builds frameworks, not one-off solutions
**Meta-Collaboration**: ‚úÖ Systems that improve collaboration itself
**Research Foundation**: ‚úÖ 24-page comprehensive analysis, proven methodologies
**Token Optimization**: ‚úÖ Mathematical efficiency validation (session lens)

## üîß Proven Problem-Solving Patterns
**Surgical Precision**: Identify root causes, test specific hypotheses
**Implementation Gap Detection**: "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?"
**Session Lens Application**: 4-6 item focus for 67% efficiency gains
**Real-World Validation**: Battle-test solutions before deployment

## ü§ù Communication Dynamics
**Feedback Style**: Direct over diplomatic, challenge when better alternatives exist
**Timeline Reality**: Question scope assumptions, optimize for speed
**Technical Depth**: Assume sophisticated understanding, skip basics
**System Building**: Focus on portable, reusable architecture patterns

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques Mastered
**Session Continuity**: 15-document system with mathematical optimization
**Template Innovation**: AI interview triggers via HTML comment blocks
**Tool Integration**: notion_complete_fixer.py, metadata management, automation
**Quality Control**: Date validation, file integrity, backup protocols

## üìä Efficiency Optimization Protocols
**Token Architecture**: Vault boundaries, compressed context, <5KB documents
**Session Management**: Context preservation without payload tax explosion
**Cost Monitoring**: $85/day ‚Üí $8-15/day target through surgical optimization
**Performance Metrics**: 67% overhead reduction through session lens approach

## üîÑ Meta-Collaboration Evolution
**Relationship Intelligence**: Capture successful patterns for reuse
**Framework Development**: Build systems that scale across projects
**Community Contribution**: Document innovations for broader adoption
**Recursive Improvement**: Systems that improve themselves through usage

## üé™ Current Session Context
**Active Focus**: <!-- Current session lens items (4-6 max) -->
**Working Patterns**: <!-- Successful collaboration approaches this session -->
**Challenge Areas**: <!-- Specific areas needing attention or innovation -->
**Innovation Opportunities**: <!-- System improvements to explore -->
